# HodoscopeDataVisualizer

## Made during the ICD 2018!

#### How to use this
When starting the program will ask for the file path, so do as the program says!
After that you just need to keep pressing enter.

#### What files does it supports?
Currently it supports only files with an indentation similar to the file example just because I didn't have any other file at hand. If you need support for other files send a feature request and the file.

The hodoscope used is 15 columns x 10 rows.
